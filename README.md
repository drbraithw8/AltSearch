Smaller Web Search Engine
-------------------------

When I finish I hope to have a web search engine.  It is not aimed at
rivalling rival major search engines, but never the less hopes to be a
web search engine.

It ought to be able to efficiently provide matches for pages on a useful
subset of the web (say 100 web sites).  One might choose to point a web
browser at a page that uses this search engine instead of major web
search engines such as Duck Duck or Google, because it will be dumb.  By
that I mean that it wont use clever algorithms, and it will bring up web
sites and pages even if they contradict the western main stream media
narratives.

Project Status
--------------
This project is just getting started.  It has a long way to go before it
yields anything useful.
