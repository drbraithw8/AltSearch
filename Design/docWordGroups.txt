							Preface
							=======
This documents some ideas that occurred to me one night.
I thought the ideas may be worth capturing, but the ideas are not complete.
These ideas may be worth pursuing later, or may turn out to be not a good idea.

							Introduction
							============

Let Sw(D) refer to the set of non-trivial words that occur at least once
in document D.

Most of Sw(Di) and Sw(Dj) will occur in the intersection of Sw(Di) and
Sw(Dj) for documents about the same topic.
A more intelligent algorithm might take advantage of this.



						Existing Design
						===============

The data structure proposed for AltSearch is like this:-

Common Words
*	Indexed on common words.  May feature a bitmap of documents that
	have those common words.

Words structure
*	Indexed on the hashes of words, giving records that contains the
	word, and a list of the hashes of documents containing those words.

Documents structure
*	Indexed on the hash of the URL, giving records that have properties
	of the document, as well as a list of the hashes of words existing
	in the document.


						Proposed Design
						===============

Introducing Groups
------------------

The words structure records will contain not only a list of
the hashes of documents, but also a list of the hashes of groups of
documents.

A group of document has:-
*	A list of words
*	A list of documents that contain all of those words.

The words structure will no longer have to have the hash of each
document in its list, because each group will refer to many documents.

The power of a group, P(G), is given by the number of words multiplied
byt the number of documents.


Creation of Groups
------------------
*	Start with a group having one document with many words.
*	If adding a document substantially increases the power of the group,
	then go ahead and add the document and remove words that are no
	longer in common with all documents.


Use of Groups
