HTML2Text
=========

Useful options supplied directly to html2text
---------------------------------------------

-ascii
	By default, when -nometa is supplied, html2text uses  UTF-8  for
	the output. Specifying this option, plain ASCII is used instead.  To
	find out how non-ASCII characters are rendered, refer to  the file
	"ascii.substitutes".

-o output-file
	Write the output to output-file instead of  standard  output.

-rcfile path
	Attempt to read the file specified in path as RC file.

-links
	Generate reference list with link targets.

-links
	Generate reference list with link targets.

	Package manager version of html2text does not have this feature.
	Nor does most of the man pages on the internet.  The source code
	version, (https://github.com/grobian/html2text) does have this
	version.  It is not well explained.  Will discover what this does
	through experimentation.


Useful options supplied via .html2textrc
........................................

*	White-space in .html2textrc must be quoted with backslashes (i.e. "\ ").
*	There are 24 options that you can specify in .html2textrc.  I need
	to provide no-op (do-nothing) or as near to no-op values as is
	possible for EACH of them.

Conclusion
..........
*	It works.

*	It seems to work hard for everything that I am trying to turn off.
	*	Tries to find alternative ways to mark up a document.  Tries to
		be a plain text web browser.
	*	Slow as a result.
	*	Complicated as a result.

*	Im starting to think that I would be better off writing something of
	my own.

Conclusion
----------

*	Could change the code so that the reference lists "-links" are
	pushed to a separate file.

*	It works.  Takes care of:-
	*	Character encoding.
	*	Javascript
	*	CSS
	*	Tags
		*	Some always have closing tags.
		*	Some never have closing tags.
		*	Some sometimes have closing tags.
	*	Links

Making my own
=============

*	Im starting to think that I would be better off writing something of
	my own.  Later, because it has to cope with stuff like javascript.

*	Would be much faster because it attempts to do much less.

*	Would be much simpler.

*	Javascript would be a pain.
	*	I have to look for the end tag, i.e. </script> tag.
	*	There could be one in a string.
		*	Need to parse out strings.
