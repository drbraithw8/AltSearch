================

This is not as scary as it seems.  I have no intention of dealing with
documents with Asian characters etc:-

*	ASCII
	*	Translate non-printable characters.
		*	Use table (256 byte array).

*	Windows-1252
	*	Simple translation table for Latin and non-printable.
		*	Use table (256 byte array) to plain ASCII.

*	UTF8
	*	I expect to find lots of these.
	*	Use fgetwc() to get a character.
	*	Use lookup table to convert to plain ASCII.  
		*	Easy to see if plain ASCII.
		*	Use a lookup if it is not:-
			*	Windows-1252 characters translated to ASCII.
			*	Ignore (replace with spaces) characters outside of Windows-1252.
