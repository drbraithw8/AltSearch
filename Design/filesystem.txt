						File System Considerations
						==========================

We could potentially use a different file system

NTFS
====
*	Has a hard limit of 2^32 files in the file system.


Ext4
====

*	Configurable limit of inodes.
	*	-i parameter on mke2fs.

*	Uses Htree.
	*	but 2 level only.
	*	Might get slow around 3e7 files.

*	Has hard limit of 2^32 files per directory.
	*	Might slow down before that point.

*	Directories get fragmented if directory grows bigger than 4096 bytes.
	*	https://www.sans.org/blog/understanding-ext4-part-6-directories
		suggests a max size of 500.
	*	Two letters from base64 would give 4096 entries, which is too
		much.  Therefore one letter in each subdirectory.


Consider MariaDb
================
I seem to be using the file system as a database.

Possible Benefits
-----------------

*	Simpler implementation.

*	Less hassle.
	*	Not worrying about file system limitations as mentioned above.

*	Consistent good performance

Possible Disadvantages
----------------------
*	Slower than in-memory implementation.

*	MIGHT be much slower than file implementation due to associations.
	*	Really dont know until tested.

*	Tables:-
	*	Words
		*	Lookup is fast
	*	Documents
		*	Lookup is fast
	*	Associations: (word,document) pairs
		*	Lookup is slow
